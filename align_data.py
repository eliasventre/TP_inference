# align_proteins.py
"""
Protein trajectory alignment using Optimal Transport (OT).

This script provides a function to align protein expression data (X_prot)
across consecutive time points when the natural pairing between cells/samples
is missing.

The alignment is done with Optimal Transport (Earth Mover's Distance).

    """
    Align protein trajectories between consecutive time points
    using Optimal Transport (OT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_prot : np.ndarray
        Protein data of shape (n_samples, n_features).
        It contains cells/samples from all time points concatenated together.

    time : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n_samples,) containing the time label of each sample.
        Example: [0,0,0,1,1,1] means 3 cells at t=0 and 3 cells at t=1.

    Returns
    -------
    X_aligned : np.ndarray
        Same shape as X_prot, but with samples at later time points
        aligned to their "parents" at the previous time points.
